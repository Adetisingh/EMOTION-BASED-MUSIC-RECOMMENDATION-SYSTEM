# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

This is a web application that recommends songs based on the user’s emotions 😊🎶. The system captures or inputs emotion data and predicts the mood using a trained deep learning model, then maps the detected emotion to a curated music playlist.
Developed using **Python** in **PyCharm**, the application provides a simple and interactive interface using **Streamlit**.

✨ **Features:-**

* 🎭 Emotion Detection using a trained deep learning model

* 🎶 Song Recommendations tailored to the predicted emotion

* 📷 Real-time Camera Input for emotion analysis

* ⚡ Streamlit Interface for a smooth and interactive experience

* 🧠 Integrated with TensorFlow/Keras for emotion classification

🚀 **Tech Stack & Tools:-**

The project uses the following libraries:

* 💻 **Python (PyCharm) –** Python development environment

* 🌐 **Streamlit –** for building the web interface

* 🔢 **NumPy –** numerical computations

* 📊 **Pandas –** data handling

* 📷 **OpenCV –** real-time face detection

* 🤖 **TensorFlow –** model building

* 🧬 **Keras –** neural network training

* 📚 **Collection –** Advanced built-in data structures

📦 **Installation:-**

1️⃣ *Install dependencies:-*
```
pip install numpy pandas opencv tensorflow keras collection
```
2️⃣ *Run the app:-*
```
streamlit run app.py
```
😊 **How It Works:-**

* 📸 The system captures your facial expression

* 🧠 Deep learning model predicts your emotion

* 🎶 A curated playlist is recommended based on user's emotions
